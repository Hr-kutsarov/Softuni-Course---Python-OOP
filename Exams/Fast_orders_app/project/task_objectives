Structure (Problem 1) and Functionality (Problem 2)
Our first task is to implement the structure and functionality of the classes (properties, methods, inheritance, etc.)
You are free to add additional attributes (instance attributes, class attributes, methods, dunder methods, etc.) to simplify your code and increase readability as long as it does not change the project's result according to the requirements and the program works properly.
1.	Class Client
In the client.py file, the class Client should be implemented.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	phone_number: str
o	A string that represents the phone number of the client
o	It must start with "0" (zero), must be 10 characters long, and must contain only numbers.
Otherwise, raise a ValueError with the message "Invalid phone number!"
•	shopping_cart: list
o	An empty list that will contain all meals (objects) added by the client
•	bill: float
o	It represents the total amount of money for all meals that the client has added to his shopping cart
o	It should be set to 0.0 initially
Methods
__init__(phone_number: str)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
2.	Class Meal
In the meal.py file, the class Meal should be implemented. It is a base class for any type of meal, and it should not be able to be instantiated.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	name: str
o	A string that represents the name of the meal
o	If the name is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "Name cannot be an empty string!"
•	price: float
o	A float number that represents the price per one piece of a meal
o	If the price is less than or equal to 0.0, raise a ValueError with the message "Invalid price!"
•	quantity: int
o	An integer that represents the quantity available (to be ordered) for that meal
Methods
__init__(name: str, price: float, quantity: int)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
It returns a string with information about the meal.
3.	Class Starter
In the starter.py file, the class Starter should be implemented. It is a type of meal.
If no quantity is given, it should be set to 60.
Methods
__init__(name: str, price: float, quantity: int)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
It should return a string on one line in the format shown below. The price should be formatted to the second decimal place:
"Starter {name}: {price}lv/piece"
4.	Class MainDish
In the main_dish.py file, the class MainDish should be implemented. It is a type of meal.
If no quantity is given, it should be set to 50.
Methods
__init__(name: str, price: float, quantity: int)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
It should return a string on one line in the format shown below. The price should be formatted to the second decimal place:
"Main Dish {name}: {price}lv/piece"
5. Class Dessert
In the dessert.py file, the class Dessert should be implemented. It is a type of meal.
If no quantity is given, it should be set to 30.
Methods
__init__(name: str, price: float, quantity: int)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
It should return a string on one line in the format shown below. The price should be formatted to the second decimal place:
"Dessert {name}: {price}lv/piece"
6. Class FoodOrdersApp
In the food_orders_app.py file, the class FoodOrdersApp should be implemented. It will contain all the functionality of the project.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	menu: list
o	An empty list that will contain all the meals (objects)
•	clients_list: list
o	An empty list that will contain all the clients (objects)
Methods
__init__()
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
register_client(client_phone_number: str)
•	Creates a client (object) and adds it to the client list and returns the message "Client {phone_number} registered successfully."
•	If a client with the same phone number is already registered, raise an Exception with the message "The client has already been registered!"
add_meals_to_menu(*meals: Meal)
•	This method adds all the meals (objects) given to the menu list.
•	If one or more of the provided objects are NOT meals (not a "Starter", a "MainDish", or a "Dessert") ignore them and keep adding only the meals.
•	Note: you will always be given meals with different names.
show_menu()
•	It should return the details() for each meal on the menu on separate lines
•	If there are less than 5 meals on the menu, raise an Exception with the message "The menu is not ready!"
add_meals_to_shopping_cart(client_phone_number: str, **meal_names_and_quantities)
The client attempts to order food. All clients can add any meal that is on the menu if there is enough quantity. You will be given a dictionary with the meal names as keys and the quantity the client wants for each meal as values.
•	Adds the meals (objects) to the client's shopping cart. It also increases the client's bill with the price for the concrete meal by the quantity added and decreases the meal quantity on the menu. Returns the message "Client {client_phone_number} successfully ordered {meal_names} for {client_bill}lv."
o	The meal names refer to all meal names on the client's shopping cart. They should be separated by a comma and a space ", ".
o	The bill is the total amount of money for all meals on the client's shopping cart. It should be formatted to the second decimal point.
•	First, the client can only add meals to his/ her cart when the menu is ready. If there are less than 5 meals on the menu, raise an Exception with the message "The menu is not ready!"
•	If the client with the provided phone number is not registered in the app, he/she should be registered automatically with the provided phone number, then he/she can continue with the order.
•	If a meal with the given name is not on the menu, raise an Exception with the message: "{meal_name} is not on the menu!"
o	If the exception is raised, the client could NOT make the order at all (none of the meals should be added to the client's shopping cart, and the bill should not be increased).
•	If there isn't enough quantity of a meal to be added to the cart, you must raise an Exception with the following message: "Not enough quantity of {meal_type}: {meal_name}!"
o	The meal types are "Starter", "MainDish" and "Dessert"
o	If the exception is raised, the client could NOT make the order at all (none of the meals should be added to the client's shopping cart, and the bill should not be increased).
cancel_order(client_phone_number: str)
You will always be given an existing client phone number.
•	The client decides to cancel his/ her order. This method removes all the meals that the client has added to his/her shopping cart and resets the bill to 0 and returns the message: "Client {phone_number} successfully canceled his order.". Keep in mind that you should update the quantity of the meals on the menu list after the cancellation.
•	If there are no meals on the client's shopping cart, raise an Exception with the message "There are no ordered meals!"
finish_order(client_phone_number: str)
You will always be given an existing client phone number.
•	The client pays the bill and receives the ordered meals. This method removes all the meals that the client has added to his/ her cart and resets the bill to 0. Then, it returns the following message: "Receipt #{receipt_id} with total amount of {total_paid_money} was successfully paid for {client_phone_number}."
o	The receipt_id is automatically generated each time a bill is paid (regardless of the client). It starts from 1 and increases by 1 with each new paid bill.
o	The total paid money should be formatted to the second decimal place.
•	If there are no meals on the client's shopping cart, raise an Exception with the message "There are no ordered meals!"
__str__()
This method should return a string with the following information:
"Food Orders App has {number_of_listed_meals} meals on the menu and {number_of_clients} clients."
•	Note: The number of listed meals is the number of added-to-the-menu meals (objects), NOT their total quantity.
